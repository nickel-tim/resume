  - header: Rapid dense packing for arbitrary objects
  - description: > 
      In this project I extended on state of the art algorithms from the area of 3D printing, to be applicable to the robotic item handling domain. 
      The visualization below shows the packing planning for arbitrary objects in a dense and stable, robot reachable configuration.
      Object placements are calculated in 24 different orientations combining to <30 ms.
      Overall packing grid precision can be tuned arbitrarily, visualization shows placements with resolution of 1 mm.
