      In this project I developed a system that was capable of performing object categorization for 3D pointclouds.
      I used Variational autoencoders (VAE) to encode the 3D pointcloud into a deep latent representation. 
      The VAE was trained on the reconstruction loss of the decoder network to force the geometric shape of the object into the latent encodings.

      After the initial training, the encodings of different objects from the same class will form clusters within the latent space.
      These clusters can then be leveraged for classification of new objects.

      The spacial relationship in the latent space can then be leverage to create clusters of objects of the same class and also clusters of object classes with a certain degree of similarity.
      The image below shows that embeddings of object classes that are geometrically alike tend to fall into closer proximity of each other within the latent space.

      The similarity of the object classes can then be used to form greater clusters that generally fit a group of object classes like vehicles (bottom right) or crockery (middle left).
      In the image below the red classes have only been introduced by a limited number of examples after training with the networks weights frozen. This shows that the generalization can work across new unseen object classes.
